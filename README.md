## üö® Security Audit Results & Remediation

This version of ALX Polly has undergone a comprehensive security audit that identified and fixed several critical vulnerabilities. Below is a detailed breakdown of the security flaws discovered and the measures implemented to address them.

### üî¥ Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified & Fixed

#### 1. **Missing Authorization in Admin Panel**
- **Vulnerability**: Any authenticated user could access the admin panel and perform administrative actions
- **Impact**: Unauthorized users could delete any poll in the system, causing data loss and service disruption
- **Attack Vector**: Direct navigation to `/admin` route
- **Remediation**: 
  - Implemented role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Added authorization checks for admin privileges
  - Redirects unauthorized users to appropriate pages
  - Requires `profiles` table with `role` field in Supabase

#### 2. **Missing Authorization in Poll Operations**
- **Vulnerability**: Users could delete and update polls they didn't own
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data modification, potential data loss
- **Attack Vector**: Manipulating poll IDs in delete/update requests
- **Remediation**:
  - Added ownership verification before any destructive operations
  - Implemented proper authorization checks in all poll actions
  - Admin override capability for legitimate administrative actions

#### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
- **Vulnerability**: Lack of input sanitization allowed malicious script injection
- **Impact**: Attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript, steal user data, hijack sessions
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious content in poll questions, options, or user names
- **Remediation**:
  - Implemented comprehensive input sanitization using regex patterns
  - Added client-side and server-side validation
  - Created centralized security utilities (`SecurityUtils.sanitizeInput()`)
  - Removes dangerous HTML tags, JavaScript, and event handlers

#### 4. **Missing Input Validation**
- **Vulnerability**: No validation for input length, format, or content type
- **Impact**: Potential DoS attacks, database corruption, unexpected behavior
- **Attack Vector**: Extremely long inputs, malformed data, special characters
- **Remediation**:
  - Added comprehensive input length validation
  - Implemented format validation (email, UUID, etc.)
  - Created centralized validation constants and utilities
  - Added real-time client-side validation with user feedback

#### 5. **Missing Rate Limiting**
- **Vulnerability**: No protection against brute force attacks or spam
- **Impact**: Account takeover attempts, service degradation, resource exhaustion
- **Attack Vector**: Rapid authentication attempts, poll creation spam
- **Remediation**:
  - Implemented general rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
  - Added stricter authentication rate limiting (5 attempts per 5 minutes)
  - IP-based rate limiting with configurable windows
  - Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers

#### 6. **Information Disclosure**
- **Vulnerability**: Admin panel exposed internal IDs and user IDs
- **Impact**: Information leakage that could aid in enumeration attacks
- **Attack Vector**: Accessing admin panel or error messages
- **Remediation**:
  - Limited sensitive information exposure
  - Implemented proper error handling without information leakage
  - Added access controls to sensitive endpoints

### üü° Medium Security Issues Addressed

#### 7. **Weak Password Requirements**
- **Vulnerability**: No password strength requirements
- **Impact**: Easy-to-guess passwords, account compromise
- **Remediation**:
  - Implemented strong password policy (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
  - Added client-side password strength validation
  - Real-time feedback on password requirements

#### 8. **Missing Security Headers**
- **Vulnerability**: No security headers to protect against common attacks
- **Impact**: Clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, XSS protection disabled
- **Remediation**:
  - Added comprehensive security headers
  - Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Added X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

### üü¢ Security Improvements Implemented

#### 9. **Centralized Security Configuration**
- **Implementation**: Created `lib/security.ts` with all security constants
- **Benefits**: Consistent security implementation, easy maintenance, centralized policy management

#### 10. **Enhanced Form Validation**
- **Implementation**: Real-time client-side validation with immediate feedback
- **Benefits**: Better user experience, prevents malicious input from reaching server

#### 11. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- **Implementation**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- **Benefits**: Prevents information disclosure while maintaining usability

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: Removes dangerous HTML tags, scripts, and event handlers
- **Length Validation**: Enforces minimum and maximum input lengths
- **Format Validation**: Email, UUID, and option index validation
- **Content Filtering**: Blocks potentially malicious content patterns

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and user role separation

- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and validation

### Rate Limiting & Protection
- **General Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- **IP-Based Tracking**: Monitors requests by client IP
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper HTTP 429 responses

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading and execution

## üîß Implementation Details

### Security Configuration (`lib/security.ts`)
```typescript
export const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  RATE_LIMIT: {
    GENERAL: { WINDOW_MS: 15 * 60 * 1000, MAX_REQUESTS: 100 },
    AUTH: { WINDOW_MS: 5 * 60 * 1000, MAX_ATTEMPTS: 5 }
  },
  INPUT_LIMITS: {
    NAME: { MIN: 2, MAX: 100 },
    EMAIL: { MIN: 3, MAX: 254 },
    PASSWORD: { MIN: 8, MAX: 128 },
    QUESTION: { MIN: 3, MAX: 500 },
    OPTION: { MIN: 1, MAX: 200 }
  }
}
```

### Input Sanitization
```typescript
static sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
  return input
    .replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '')
    .replace(/<iframe\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/iframe>)<[^<]*)*<\/iframe>/gi, '')
    .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')
    .replace(/on\w+\s*=/gi, '')
    .trim();
}
```

### Authorization Check Example
```typescript
// Check if user owns the poll
if (poll.user_id !== user.id) {
  // Check if user is admin
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single();

  if (profile?.role !== 'admin') {
    return { error: "You can only delete your own polls." };
  }
}
```
